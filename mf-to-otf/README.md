## OTF Output

This directory contains `.otf` generated files from the `legacy-sources/mf-ethiop` folders, the subdirectories here
mirror the directories from source folder.

### convert-mf.sh
This is a batch file which takes the source directory as an argument and converts `.mf`
files in subdirectories thereof.  `convert-mf.sh` passes the `.mf` files it finds to the
`mf2ff.py` script.  Output files are then copied over locally and the `.log` files that
get created are deleted. 

### mf2ff.py
This is a slightly modified version of the original that avoids failing when irregular
responses come back from an API that handles the `fontdimen` metafont command.  The
numbers being returned contain a `:` only, or also with a number like `:5` .  Why this
happens is unknown, it is likely to do with the age of the source metafont files (possible
syntaax errors) or with limitations in the mf2ff.py fascility.
